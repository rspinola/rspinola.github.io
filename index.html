<p>Hi there! I'm an Engineer from Mexico who's been living in the U.S. for over a decade. For the past 7 years I led the engineering team at Function of Beauty, a YC-backed startup that manufactures custom beauty products. I started as a web developer in a tiny co-working space with a handful of people, and led the development of the website as the company grew and grew. I'm currently taking a break and doing some consulting supporting a major transition at the company looking for another interesting challenge.</p>
